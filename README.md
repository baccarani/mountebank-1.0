# Get Started

Run 2 terminals, cd into frontend and backend folders, run **npm i** in the frontend folder and run **npm start** in both folders.

# Mountebank

Mountebank is the first open source tool to provide cross-platform, multi-protocol test doubles over the wire. Simply point your application under test to mountebank instead of the real dependency, and test like you would with traditional stubs and mocks.

Mountebank is the most capable open source service virtualization tool in existence, and will cure what ails you, guaranteed.
